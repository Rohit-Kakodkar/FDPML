# Frequency Domain Perfectly Matched Layer (FDPML) - version 1.0

Version 1.0 solves for only singular modes without wave superposition 

## Introduction

FDPML is a computational method to simulate heat transport through nanostructured materials. The method converts atomistic equations of motion for every atom inside a simulation domain to a set of linear algebraic equations. The equations can then be solved using iterative solvers. The model is efficient as it stores the matrices in sparse format (COO), while also being able to be deployed across multiple cluster node.

For a more detailed mathematical description of the model please refer

## Installation

### Dependencies

1. MPI
1. openmpi FORTRAN90 Compiler
1. IntelMKL

Clone this repository using `git clone git@github.com:Rohit-Kakodkar/FDPML.git`

Install using Makefile : `make all`

Upon installation execultables will be created in `\bin` folder

## Usage

### Overview

The method can be used to obtain 2 properties intrinsic to heat transport through nanostructured materials.

1. Transmission coefficient across interfaces- Please refer [here](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.125434)
2. Scattering Cross-section due to nanoparticles- Please refer [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5031757)

Input parameters for simulations are specified through input cards described below

All quantities whose dimensions are not explicitly specified are in RYDBERG ATOMIC UNITS. Charge is "number" charge (i.e. not multiplied by e); potentials are in energy units (i.e. they are multiplied by e).
